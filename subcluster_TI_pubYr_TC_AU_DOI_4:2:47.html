To describe collective plasma;excitations in the 2DEG, we develop a generalized transmission line;theoretical formalism consistent with the plasma hydrodynamic model. We;then apply this formalism to analyze the plasmonic spectra of 2DEG;systems with steplike periodic changes of electron density, gate;screening, or both. We show that in a periodically modulated 2DEG, a;plasmonic crystal is formed, and we derive closed-form analytical;expressions describing its energy band spectrum for both infinite and;finite size crystals. Our results demonstrate a nonmonotonic dependence;of the plasmonic band gap width on the electron density modulation. At;so-called transparency points, where the plasmon propagates through the;periodic 2DEG in a resonant manner, the plasmonic band gaps vanish. In;semi-infinite plasmonic crystals, we demonstrate the formation of;plasmonic Tamm states and analytically derive their energy dispersion;and spatial localization. Finally, we present detailed numerical;analysis of the plasmonic band structure of a finite four-period;plasmonic crystal terminated either by an ohmic contact or by an;infinite barrier on each side. We trace the evolution of the plasmonic;band spectrum, including the Tamm states, with changing electron density;modulation and analyze the boundary conditions necessary for formation;of the Tamm states. We also analyze interaction between the Tamm states;formed at the opposite edges of the short length plasmonic crystal. The;validity of our theoretical approach was confirmed in experimental;studies of plasmonic crystals in short, modulated plasmonic cavities;[Dyer et al., Phys. Rev.

The measured 1/f;noise around the magnetic hysteresis loops of the free layer indicates;that the main origin of the 1/f noise is the magnetic fluctuation, which;is discussed in terms of a fluctuation-dissipation relation. Random;telegraph noise (RTN) is observed to be symmetrically enhanced in the;hysteresis loop with regard to the two magnetic configurations. We found;that this enhancement is caused by the fluctuation between two magnetic;states in the free layer. Although the 1/f noise is almost independent;of the magnetic configuration, the RTN is enhanced in the antiparallel;configuration. These findings indicate the presence of spin-dependent;activation of RTN. Shot noise reveals the spin-dependent coherent;tunneling process via a crystalline MgO barrier.

We have determined both the;field-current state diagrams for the domain-wall state and the thermally;activated dynamics of the nucleation and depinning processes. We show;that the nucleation process is well-described by a modified Neel-Brown;model taking into account the spin-transfer torque, whereas the;depinning process is independent of the current. This is confirmed by an;analytical calculation which shows that spin-torques have no effect on;the Arrhenius escape rate associated with thermally activated domain;wall depinning in this geometry. Furthermore, micromagnetic simulations;indicate that spin-transfer only weakly affects the domain wall motion,;but instead modifies the inner domain wall structure.

This is possible owing;to the extreme sensitivity of the o/afm (for T <= T-s,T-N) and;superconducting (T <= T-c) states against variation of pressure,;disclosing pressure coefficients of dT(s,N)/dP = -(1100 +/- 50) K/GPa;and dT(c)/dP = -(60 +/- 3) K/GPa, respectively. Systematic;investigations of the various phase transitions and ground states via;pressure tuning revealed no coexistence of bulk superconductivity (sc);with the o/afm state which we link to the strongly first-order character;of the corresponding structural/magnetic transition in this compound.;Our results, together with literature results, indicate that preserving;fluctuations associated with the o/afm transition to low enough;temperatures is vital for sc to form.

An objective structure (OS) is one for which a;group of atoms, called a "fundamental domain" (FD), is repeated using;specific rules of translation and rotation to build a more complex;structure. An objective Cauchy-Born rule defines the kinematics of the;OS atoms in terms of a set of symmetry parameters and the positions of;the FD atoms. The computational advantage lies in the capability of;representing a large system of atoms through a small set of symmetry;parameters and FD atom positions. As an illustrative example, we;consider the deformation of a copper single-crystal nanobeam which can;be described as an OS. OQC simulations are performed for uniform and;nonuniform bending for two different orientations (nanobeam axis;oriented along [111] and [100]) and compared with elastica results. In;the uniform bending case, the [111]-oriented single-crystal nanobeam;experiences elongation, while the [100]-oriented nanobeam experiences;contraction in total length.

Neutron diffraction experiments were;carried out both in the ground state (zero magnetic field) and under;applied external field of 2.5 and 5 T corresponding to the ferrimagnetic;and ferromagnetic states, respectively. The antiferromagnetic ground;state below 14 K corresponds to k = (1,0, 1/2) magnetic propagation;vector in C1 space group.

The problem is;formulated in terms of finite-temperature DFT where the discontinuity in;the xc potential emerges naturally in the limit of zero temperature. A;simple parametrization is suggested for the xc potential of the uniform;one-dimensional (1D) Hubbard model at finite temperature which is;obtained from the solution of the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz. The;feasibility of the numerical scheme is demonstrated by application to a;model of fermionic atoms in a harmonic trap. The corresponding density;profile exhibits a plateau of integer occupation at low temperatures;which melts away for higher temperatures.

Regrettably, themechanism(s);responsible for the superconductivity has yet to be unequivocally;identified. High pressure is an important variable since its application;moderates the pairing interaction. Thus far, the LnFePO (Ln = La, Pr,;Nd, Sm, Gd) family of superconductors has received relatively little;attention. Early high-pressure studies on LaFePO found that T-c;initially increased with pressure before passing through a maximum at;higher pressures. The present studies on both polycrystalline and;single-crystalline LaFePO, PrFePO, and NdFePO utilize the most;hydrostatic pressure medium available, i.e., dense He.

It is suggested that disorder creates isolated pseudospins which;become centers of inelastic scattering of electrons. It is suggested;that this scattering is responsible for the logarithmic upturn in the;resistivity rho(T) similar to - ln T observed at low doping.

If g denotes the parameter in the Hamiltonian with;respect to which the fidelity is computed, we find that for;one-dimensional models with large but finite size, the fidelity;susceptibility chi(F) can detect a QCP provided that the correlation;length exponent satisfies nu < 2. We then show that chi(F) can be used;to locate a QCP even if nu >= 2 if we introduce boundary conditions;labeled by a twist angle N theta, where N is the system size. If the QCP;lies at g = 0, we find that if N is kept constant, chi(F) has a scaling;form given by chi(F) similar to theta(-2/nu) f (g/theta(1/nu)) if theta;<< 2 pi/N. We illustrate this both in a tight-binding model of fermions;with a spatially varying chemical potential with amplitude h and period;2q in which nu = q, and in a XY spin-1/2 chain in which nu = 2. Finally;we show that when q is very large, the model has two additional QCPs at;h = +/- 2 which cannot be detected by studying the energy spectrum but;are clearly detected by chi(F). The peak value and width of chi(F) seem;to scale as nontrivial powers of q at these QCPs. We argue that these;QCPs mark a transition between extended and localized states at the;Fermi energy.

The;analysis of their microscopic origin allows us to postulate the;associated laws and leads to a deeper understanding of polarization;reversal dynamics in general. In addition, we find that in defect-free;nanowires the polarization reversal can occur within picoseconds, which;potentially is very promising for ultrafast memory and other;applications.

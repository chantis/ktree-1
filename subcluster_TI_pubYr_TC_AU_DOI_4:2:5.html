To describe collective plasma;excitations in the 2DEG, we develop a generalized transmission line;theoretical formalism consistent with the plasma hydrodynamic model. We;then apply this formalism to analyze the plasmonic spectra of 2DEG;systems with steplike periodic changes of electron density, gate;screening, or both. We show that in a periodically modulated 2DEG, a;plasmonic crystal is formed, and we derive closed-form analytical;expressions describing its energy band spectrum for both infinite and;finite size crystals. Our results demonstrate a nonmonotonic dependence;of the plasmonic band gap width on the electron density modulation. At;so-called transparency points, where the plasmon propagates through the;periodic 2DEG in a resonant manner, the plasmonic band gaps vanish. In;semi-infinite plasmonic crystals, we demonstrate the formation of;plasmonic Tamm states and analytically derive their energy dispersion;and spatial localization. Finally, we present detailed numerical;analysis of the plasmonic band structure of a finite four-period;plasmonic crystal terminated either by an ohmic contact or by an;infinite barrier on each side. We trace the evolution of the plasmonic;band spectrum, including the Tamm states, with changing electron density;modulation and analyze the boundary conditions necessary for formation;of the Tamm states. We also analyze interaction between the Tamm states;formed at the opposite edges of the short length plasmonic crystal. The;validity of our theoretical approach was confirmed in experimental;studies of plasmonic crystals in short, modulated plasmonic cavities;[Dyer et al., Phys. Rev.

The measured 1/f;noise around the magnetic hysteresis loops of the free layer indicates;that the main origin of the 1/f noise is the magnetic fluctuation, which;is discussed in terms of a fluctuation-dissipation relation. Random;telegraph noise (RTN) is observed to be symmetrically enhanced in the;hysteresis loop with regard to the two magnetic configurations. We found;that this enhancement is caused by the fluctuation between two magnetic;states in the free layer. Although the 1/f noise is almost independent;of the magnetic configuration, the RTN is enhanced in the antiparallel;configuration. These findings indicate the presence of spin-dependent;activation of RTN. Shot noise reveals the spin-dependent coherent;tunneling process via a crystalline MgO barrier.

This is confirmed by an;analytical calculation which shows that spin-torques have no effect on;the Arrhenius escape rate associated with thermally activated domain;wall depinning in this geometry.

The algorithm used;for the simulations presented here is based on the observation that;adatom and dimer motion is essentially decoupled from the elastic field.;This is exploited by decomposing the film into two parts: the weakly;bonded portion and the strongly bonded portion. The weakly bonded;portion is taken to evolve independent of the elastic field. In this way;the elastic field need only be updated infrequently.

We then show that chi(F) can be used;to locate a QCP even if nu >= 2 if we introduce boundary conditions;labeled by a twist angle N theta, where N is the system size.

The procedure is applied;to the Al-Zr system because of its importance in the development of high;strength Al-Li alloys and of bulk metallic glasses. Cohesive energies of;the studied condensed phases of the Al-Zr system (the liquid phase, the;fcc solid solution, and various orthorhombic stoichiometric compounds);are calculated using the modified embedded atom model (MEAM) in the;second-nearest-neighbor formalism (2NN). The Al-Zr MEAM-2NN potential is;parameterized in this work using ab initio and experimental data found;in the literature for the AlZr3-L1(2) structure, while its predictive;ability is confirmed for several other solid structures and for the;liquid phase. The thermodynamic integration (TI) method is implemented;in a general MC algorithm in order to evaluate the absolute Gibbs energy;of the liquid and the fcc solutions. The entropy of mixing calculated;from the TI method, combined to the enthalpy of mixing and the heat;capacity data generated from MD/MC simulations performed in the;isobaric-isothermal/canonical (NPT/NVT) ensembles are used to;parameterize the Gibbs energy function of all the condensed phases in;the Al-rich side of the Al-Zr system in a CALculation of PHAse Diagrams;(CALPHAD) approach. The modified quasichemical model in the pair;approximation (MQMPA) and the cluster variation method (CVM) in the;tetrahedron approximation are used to define the Gibbs energy of the;liquid and the fcc solid solution respectively for their entire range of;composition. Thermodynamic and structural data generated from our MD/MC;simulations are used as input data to parameterize these thermodynamic;models. A detailed analysis of the validity and transferability of the;Al-Zr MEAM-2NN potential is presented throughout our work by comparing;the predicted properties obtained from this formalism with available ab;initio and experimental data for both liquid and solid phases.

Further, the;Joule heating dissipation contribution and the noise-equivalent;dissipation energy were reduced by setting a smaller amplitude. Usage of;a high resonance frequency and a smaller amplitude enables us to perform;highly sensitive measurements of the atomic-scale adhesion and the;tip-instability-related energy dissipation. Tip changes, caused by;tip-sample interactions and thermal energy, resulted in three different;dissipation energy levels (Delta E-ts approximate to 25 meV/cycle). This;infrequent change of the tip apex condition often prevents a stable;imaging with small amplitude. Our systematic measurement shows that the;atomic adhesion is caused mainly in the tip itself, and a sharper and;softer tip induced a larger energy dissipation.

Currently,;crystalline defects such as dislocations limit the performance of these;materials. Atomistic simulations are a powerful method for exploring;crystalline defects at a resolution unattainable by experimental;techniques. To enable accurate atomistic simulations of defects in the;Cd-Zn-Te systems, we develop a full Cd-Zn-Te ternary bond-order;potential. This Cd-Zn-Te potential has numerous unique advantages over;other potential formulations: (1) It is analytically derived from;quantum mechanical theories and is therefore more likely to be;transferable to environments that are not explicitly tested. (2) A;variety of elemental and compound configurations (with coordination;varying from 1 to 12) including small clusters, bulk lattices, defects,;and surfaces are explicitly considered during parameterization. As a;result, the potential captures structural and property trends close to;those seen in experiments and quantum mechanical calculations and;provides a good description of melting temperature, defect;characteristics, and surface reconstructions. (3) Most importantly, this;potential is validated to correctly predict the crystalline growth of;the ground-state structures for Cd, Zn, Te elements as well as CdTe,;ZnTe, and Cd1-xZnxTe compounds during highly challenging molecular;dynamics vapor deposition simulations.

We find that the half-metallicity of CrO2;remains intact for the ground state of all of the calculated;substitutions. We also observe two periodic trends as a function of the;number of valence electrons: if the substituted atom has six or fewer;valence electrons, the number of down spin electrons associated with the;impurity ion is zero, resulting in ferromagnetic alignment of the;impurity magnetic moment with the magnetization of the CrO2 host. For;substituent atoms with eight to ten valence electrons (with the;exception of Ni), the number of down-spin electrons contributed by the;impurity ion remains fixed at three as the number contributed to the;majority increases from one to three resulting in antiferromagnetic;alignment between impurity moment and host magnetization. In impurities;with seven valence electrons, the zero down-spin and threse down-spin;configurations are very close in energy. At 11 valence electrons, the;energy is minimized when the substituent ion contributes five down-spin;electrons. The moments on the 4d impurities, particularly Nb and Mo,;tend to be delocalized compared with those of the 3ds.

A transfer matrix;formalism for cylindrical multilayered structures is used in association;with cavity phase matching considerations to design structures that;support Tamm plasmon polaritons at specified frequencies, and to explore;the field distributions and the dispersion relations of the excitations.;The cylindrical TPPs can exist in both the TE and TM polarizations for;the special cases of modes with either azimuthal isotropy or zero axial;propagation constant and also as hybrid cylindrical modes when neither;of those conditions applies. In the cases considered the TPPs have low;effective masses and low group velocities. Also, when there is both;metallic core and cladding, near degenerate modes localized at each;metallic interface can couple to produce symmetric and antisymmetric;combinations whose frequency difference is in the terahertz regime.

The formulas in the existing literature are frequently;incomplete, incorrect, or lack a derivation; in particular, Hall;viscosity is overlooked. Our approach begins from the response to a;uniform external strain field, which is an active time-dependent;coordinate transformation in d space dimensions. These transformations;form the group GL(d, R) of invertible matrices, and the infinitesimal;generators are called strain generators. These enable us to express the;Kubo formula in different ways, related by Ward identities; some of;these make contact with the adiabatic transport approach.

For;Galilean-invariant systems, we derive a relation between the stress;response tensor and the conductivity tensor that is valid at all;frequencies and in both the presence and absence of a magnetic field.

On the O-polar face, the position of the Fermi;level could be reversibly cycled between the conduction band and the;band gap over an energetic distance of approximately 0.8 eV (similar to;1/4 of the band gap) by controlling the surface H coverage using simple;ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) heat treatments up to 750 degrees C, dosing with;H2O/H-2 and atmospheric exposure. A metallic to semiconductorlike;transition in the electronic nature of the O-polar face was observed at;an H coverage of approximately 0.9 monolayers. For H coverage less than;this, semiconducting (depleted) O-polar surfaces were created that were;reasonably stable in UHV conditions.

In this study, we show that;octahedral rotations of the SrRuO3 films can be controlled by oxygen;vacancies as well as by interfacial coupling, which further determines;the physical properties. Half-integer reflections using high-resolution;synchrotron x-ray diffraction were carried out to determine the;octahedral rotation pattern of SrRuO3 films on SrTiO3 substrates. The;transition of RuO6 rotation pattern accompanied by the structural change;from monoclinic P2(1)/m to tetragonal F4/mmc can be understood from the;preference of oxygen vacancies in the SrO atomic plane and the coupling;of octahedra across the interface between film and substrate. The field;angle dependence of magnetoresistance further confirmed the structural;phase transition with changes in octahedral rotations. The monoclinic;phase has the uniaxial magnetic easy axis 30 away from the [001];direction towards the [010] direction while the tetragonal phase has;uniaxial magnetic easy axis along the fourfold axis which is;perpendicular to the film surface.

  TC:1  AU: ;FN Thomson Reuters Web of Science™;1.0;J;Aizin, Gregory R.;Dyer, Gregory C.;Transmission line theory of collective plasma excitations in periodic;two-dimensional electron systems: Finite plasmonic crystals and Tamm;states;PHYSICAL REVIEW B;86;23;235316;10.1103/PhysRevB.86.235316;DEC 28 2012;2012;We present a comprehensive theory of the one-dimensional plasmonic;crystal formed in the grating-gated two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG);in semiconductor heterostructures. To describe collective plasma;excitations in the 2DEG, we develop a generalized transmission line;theoretical formalism consistent with the plasma hydrodynamic model. We;then apply this formalism to analyze the plasmonic spectra of 2DEG;systems with steplike periodic changes of electron density, gate;screening, or both. We show that in a periodically modulated 2DEG, a;plasmonic crystal is formed, and we derive closed-form analytical;expressions describing its energy band spectrum for both infinite and;finite size crystals. Our results demonstrate a nonmonotonic dependence;of the plasmonic band gap width on the electron density modulation. At;so-called transparency points, where the plasmon propagates through the;periodic 2DEG in a resonant manner, the plasmonic band gaps vanish. In;semi-infinite plasmonic crystals, we demonstrate the formation of;plasmonic Tamm states and analytically derive their energy dispersion;and spatial localization. Finally, we present detailed numerical;analysis of the plasmonic band structure of a finite four-period;plasmonic crystal terminated either by an ohmic contact or by an;infinite barrier on each side. We trace the evolution of the plasmonic;band spectrum, including the Tamm states, with changing electron density;modulation and analyze the boundary conditions necessary for formation;of the Tamm states. We also analyze interaction between the Tamm states;formed at the opposite edges of the short length plasmonic crystal. The;validity of our theoretical approach was confirmed in experimental;studies of plasmonic crystals in short, modulated plasmonic cavities;[Dyer et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 126803 (2012)], which demonstrated;excellent quantitative agreement between theory and experiment.;DOI:10.1103/PhysRevB.86.235316;9;0;0;0;9;1098-0121;WOS:000312833200005;;;J;Arakawa, Tomonori;Tanaka, Takahiro;Chida, Kensaku;Matsuo, Sadashige;Nishihara, Yoshitaka;Chiba, Daichi;Kobayashi, Kensuke;Ono, Teruo;Fukushima, Akio;Yuasa, Shinji;Low-frequency and shot noises in CoFeB/MgO/CoFeB magnetic tunneling;junctions;PHYSICAL REVIEW B;86;22;224423;10.1103/PhysRevB.86.224423;DEC 28 2012;2012;The low-frequency and shot noises in spin-valve CoFeB/MgO/CoFeB magnetic;tunneling junctions were studied at low temperature. The measured 1/f;noise around the magnetic hysteresis loops of the free layer indicates;that the main origin of the 1/f noise is the magnetic fluctuation, which;is discussed in terms of a fluctuation-dissipation relation. Random;telegraph noise (RTN) is observed to be symmetrically enhanced in the;hysteresis loop with regard to the two magnetic configurations. We found;that this enhancement is caused by the fluctuation between two magnetic;states in the free layer. Although the 1/f noise is almost independent;of the magnetic configuration, the RTN is enhanced in the antiparallel;configuration. These findings indicate the presence of spin-dependent;activation of RTN. Shot noise reveals the spin-dependent coherent;tunneling process via a crystalline MgO barrier.

Our aim is to show how to avoid the uncertainties common in;electrical transport models arising from the need to fit a large number;of parameters when little information is available, for example, a;single current-voltage curve. Here, simulation parameters are derived;from a series of measurements using a self-consistent "building-blocks";approach, starting from data on the simplest systems. We found that site;energies show disorder and that correlations in the site energies and a;distribution of deep traps must be included in order to reproduce;measured charge mobility-field curves at low charge densities in bulk;PFB and F8BT. The parameter set from the mobility-field curves;reproduces the unipolar current in single layers of PFB and F8BT and;allows us to deduce charge injection barriers. Finally, by combining;these disorder descriptions and injection barriers with an optical;model, the external quantum efficiency and current densities of blend;and bilayer organic PV devices can be successfully reproduced across a;voltage range encompassing reverse and forward bias, with the;recombination rate the only parameter to be fitted, found to be 1 x;10(7) s(-1). These findings demonstrate an approach that removes some of;the arbitrariness present in transport models of organic devices, which;validates the KMC as an accurate description of organic optoelectronic;systems, and provides information on the microscopic origins of the;device behavior.

Therefore, the understanding of basic electrical;properties of individual nanoislands is crucial. Here, the electrical;and photovoltaic properties of individual self-assembled Ge nanodomes;(NDs) on Si(001) have been studied by conductive and photoconductive;atomic force microscopy (AFM). The transition areas between the {113};and {15 3 23} facets turned out to be most conductive whereas the {113};facets exhibit minimum conductivity, which is attributed to a local;increase in Si concentration. Local current-to-voltage measurements;revealed that the NDs show an ohmic resistance, which is in the M Omega;region and scales with the ND-substrate interface area. Upon;illumination by the AFM feedback laser at 860 nm, a photovoltage is;generated. This photovoltage originates in the p-i-n structure formed;between the p-type substrate, the Ge ND, and the n-type diamond AFM;probe.

When the packet propagates along a chiral quantum;Hall edge, we find that its electron density profile becomes more;distorted from Lorentzian due to the generation of electron-hole;excitations, as the interaction strength increases yet stays in a;weak-interaction regime. However, as the interaction strength becomes;larger and enters a strong-interaction regime, the distortion becomes;weaker and eventually the Lorentzian packet shape is recovered. The;recovery of the packet shape leads to an interesting feature of the;interference visibility of the symmetric Mach-Zehnder interferometer;whose two arms have the same interaction strength. As the interaction;strength increases, the visibility decreases from the maximum value in;the weak-interaction regime and then increases to the maximum value in;the strong-interaction regime.

We report detailed;analyses of the resonance lines, which fully resolve the cyclotron mass;structure of the main Fermi surface sheets. A particular focus is given;to the anomalous splitting of the sharpest resonance line near the [110];direction under in-plane magnetic-field rotation, which implies peculiar;electronic structure in the hidden-order phase. The results under the;field rotation from [110] toward [001] direction reveal that the;splitting is a robust feature against field tilting from the basal;plane. This is in sharp contrast to the reported frequency branch alpha;in the quantum oscillation experiments showing a three-fold splitting;that disappears by a small field tilt, which can be explained by the;magnetic breakdown between the large hole sphere and small electron;pockets. Our analysis of the cyclotron resonance profiles reveals that;the heavier branch of the split line has a larger scattering rate,;providing evidence for the existence of hot-spot regions along the [110];direction. These results are consistent with the broken fourfold;rotational symmetry in the hidden-order phase, which can modify the;interband scattering in an asymmetric manner. We also extend our;measurements down to 0.7 K, which results in the observation of;cyclotron resonance in the superconducting state, where novel effects of;vortex dynamics may enter.

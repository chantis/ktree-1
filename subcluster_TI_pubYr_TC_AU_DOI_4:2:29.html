On the O-polar face, the position of the Fermi;level could be reversibly cycled between the conduction band and the;band gap over an energetic distance of approximately 0.8 eV (similar to;1/4 of the band gap) by controlling the surface H coverage using simple;ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) heat treatments up to 750 degrees C, dosing with;H2O/H-2 and atmospheric exposure.

Large spin;Hall angles have been now measured in heavy metals like W(Phi(H) =;-0.33) and Cu doped with Bi impurities (Phi(H) = -0.24). In this article;we express the contributions to the SHE induced by skew scattering and;scattering with side-jump from Bi impurities in Cu, and we use ab initio;calculations of the electronic structure of CuBi alloys to estimate the;values of these two contributions.

In this study, we show that;octahedral rotations of the SrRuO3 films can be controlled by oxygen;vacancies as well as by interfacial coupling, which further determines;the physical properties. Half-integer reflections using high-resolution;synchrotron x-ray diffraction were carried out to determine the;octahedral rotation pattern of SrRuO3 films on SrTiO3 substrates. The;transition of RuO6 rotation pattern accompanied by the structural change;from monoclinic P2(1)/m to tetragonal F4/mmc can be understood from the;preference of oxygen vacancies in the SrO atomic plane and the coupling;of octahedra across the interface between film and substrate. The field;angle dependence of magnetoresistance further confirmed the structural;phase transition with changes in octahedral rotations. The monoclinic;phase has the uniaxial magnetic easy axis 30 away from the [001];direction towards the [010] direction while the tetragonal phase has;uniaxial magnetic easy axis along the fourfold axis which is;perpendicular to the film surface.

Using real-space mean-field theory, we numerically;determine the phase as a function of the interaction strength for;different values of the gauge-field parameter. For a fixed value of the;gauge field, we observe that when the strength of the repulsive;interaction is increased, the system enters into an antiferromagnetic;phase, then undergoes a first-order phase transition to a noncollinear;magnetic phase. Depending on the gauge-field parameter, this phase;further evolves to the one predicted from the effective Heisenberg model;obtained in the limit of large interaction strength. We explain the;presence of the antiferromagnetic phase at small interaction from the;computation of the spin-spin susceptibility, which displays a divergence;at low temperatures for the antiferromagnetic ordering. We discuss, how;the divergence is related to the nature of the underlying Fermi;surfaces. Finally, the fact that the first-order phase transitions for;different gauge-field parameters occur at unrelated critical interaction;strengths arises from a Hofstadter-like situation, i.e., for different;magnetic phases, the mean-field Hamiltonians have different;translational symmetries.;1;0;0;0;1;1098-0121;WOS:000332163500001;;;J;Rochal, S.

To describe collective plasma;excitations in the 2DEG, we develop a generalized transmission line;theoretical formalism consistent with the plasma hydrodynamic model. We;then apply this formalism to analyze the plasmonic spectra of 2DEG;systems with steplike periodic changes of electron density, gate;screening, or both. We show that in a periodically modulated 2DEG, a;plasmonic crystal is formed, and we derive closed-form analytical;expressions describing its energy band spectrum for both infinite and;finite size crystals. Our results demonstrate a nonmonotonic dependence;of the plasmonic band gap width on the electron density modulation. At;so-called transparency points, where the plasmon propagates through the;periodic 2DEG in a resonant manner, the plasmonic band gaps vanish. In;semi-infinite plasmonic crystals, we demonstrate the formation of;plasmonic Tamm states and analytically derive their energy dispersion;and spatial localization.

While the;current-phase relation for the JJ at zero magnetic field is;qualitatively unchanged by SOC, in the presence of a weak magnetic;field, a strongly anisotropic behavior and the mentioned anomalous;Josephson effects follow. We show that the situation is not restricted;to barriers based on constrictions such as QPCs and should generically;arise if in the normal system the direction of the carrier's spin is;linked to its direction of motion.

Regrettably, themechanism(s);responsible for the superconductivity has yet to be unequivocally;identified. High pressure is an important variable since its application;moderates the pairing interaction. Thus far, the LnFePO (Ln = La, Pr,;Nd, Sm, Gd) family of superconductors has received relatively little;attention. Early high-pressure studies on LaFePO found that T-c;initially increased with pressure before passing through a maximum at;higher pressures. The present studies on both polycrystalline and;single-crystalline LaFePO, PrFePO, and NdFePO utilize the most;hydrostatic pressure medium available, i.e., dense He. Surprisingly, for;all samples, T-c is found to initially decrease rapidly with pressure at;the rate dT(c)/dP similar or equal to -2 to -3K/GPa. Less hydrostatic;pressure media thus appear to enhance the value of T-c in these;materials. These results give yet further evidence that the;superconducting state in Fe-based superconductors is extraordinarly;sensitive to lattice strain.

If g denotes the parameter in the Hamiltonian with;respect to which the fidelity is computed, we find that for;one-dimensional models with large but finite size, the fidelity;susceptibility chi(F) can detect a QCP provided that the correlation;length exponent satisfies nu < 2. We then show that chi(F) can be used;to locate a QCP even if nu >= 2 if we introduce boundary conditions;labeled by a twist angle N theta, where N is the system size. If the QCP;lies at g = 0, we find that if N is kept constant, chi(F) has a scaling;form given by chi(F) similar to theta(-2/nu) f (g/theta(1/nu)) if theta;<< 2 pi/N. We illustrate this both in a tight-binding model of fermions;with a spatially varying chemical potential with amplitude h and period;2q in which nu = q, and in a XY spin-1/2 chain in which nu = 2. Finally;we show that when q is very large, the model has two additional QCPs at;h = +/- 2 which cannot be detected by studying the energy spectrum but;are clearly detected by chi(F). The peak value and width of chi(F) seem;to scale as nontrivial powers of q at these QCPs. We argue that these;QCPs mark a transition between extended and localized states at the;Fermi energy.

Thus;we demonstrate that topology describes the properties of the exact;spectrum beyond the quasiclassical approximation.

To this end, we further develop the general,;finite-temperature real-time transport formalism by introducing field;superoperators that obey fermionic statistics. This direct second;quantization in Liouville Fock space strongly simplifies the;construction of operators and superoperators that transform irreducibly;under the Anderson-model symmetry transformations. The fermionic field;superoperators naturally arise from the univalence (fermion-parity);superselection rule of quantum mechanics for the total system of quantum;dot plus reservoirs. Expressed in these field superoperators, the causal;structure of the perturbation theory for the effective time-evolution;superoperator kernel becomes explicit. Using the constraints of the;causal structure, we construct a parametrization of the exact effective;time-evolution kernel for which we analytically find the eigenvectors;and eigenvalues in terms of a minimal set of only 30 independent;coefficients. The causal structure also implies the existence of a;fermion-parity protected eigenvector of the exact Liouvillian,;explaining a recently reported result on adiabatic driving;[Contreras-Pulido et al., Phys.

The remaining diagrams can be identified simply by their;topology and are manifestly independent of the energy cutoff term by;term. By an exact reformulation of this series, we integrate out all;infinite-temperature effects, obtaining an expansion targeting only the;nontrivial, finite-temperature corrections, and the exactly conserved;transport current follows directly from the time-evolution kernel. From;this new series, the previously formulated RT-RG equations are obtained;naturally. We perform a complete one-plus-two-loop RG analysis at finite;voltage and magnetic field, while systematically accounting for the;dependence of all renormalized quantities on both the quantum dot and;reservoir frequencies. Using the second quantization in Liouville space;and symmetry restrictions, we obtain analytical RT-RG equations, which;can be solved numerically in an efficient way, and we extensively study;the model parameter space, excluding the Kondo regime where the;one-plus-two-loop approach is obviously invalid. The incorporated;renormalization effects result in an enhancement of the inelastic;cotunneling peak, even at a voltage similar to magnetic field similar to;tunnel coupling Gamma.

For;Galilean-invariant systems, we derive a relation between the stress;response tensor and the conductivity tensor that is valid at all;frequencies and in both the presence and absence of a magnetic field. In;the presence of a magnetic field and at low frequency, this yields a;relation between the Hall viscosity, the q(2) part of the Hall;conductivity, the inverse compressibility (suitably defined), and the;diverging part of the shear viscosity (if any); this relation;generalizes a result found recently by others. We show that the correct;value of the Hall viscosity at zero frequency can be obtained (at least;in the absence of low-frequency bulk and shear viscosity) by assuming;that there is an orbital spin per particle that couples to a perturbing;electromagnetic field as a magnetization per particle.

The;quasinormal modes determine the poles and zeros of the conductivity in;the complex frequency plane, and so fully determine its behavior on the;real frequency axis, at frequencies both smaller and larger than the;absolute temperature. We describe the role of particle-vortex or S;duality on the conductivity, specifically how it maps poles to zeros and;vice versa.

Two cases are considered. The first is the;counterflowing (Vinen) turbulence, where the vortex lines are;disordered, and the evolution of quantity L(t) obeys the Vinen equation.;The second case is the fluctuations of the VLD in a single vortex;bundle, which develops inside the domain of the concentrated;normal-fluid vorticity. The dynamics of the vortex bundle is described;by the Hall-Vinen-Bekarevich-Khalatnikov (HVBK) equations. The latter;case is of special interest, because the set of the quantum vortex;bundles is believed to mimic classical hydrodynamic turbulence. In;steady states the VLD is related to the normal velocity as L = (rho;gamma/rho(s))(2)upsilon(2)(n) for the Vinen case. In the vortex bundle;case, which appears inside the domain of a concentrated vorticity of;normal fluid, the stationary quantity L can be found from the matching;of velocities and is described by L = vertical bar del x v(n)vertical;bar/kappa. In nonstationary situations, and particularly in the;fluctuating turbulent flow, there is a retardation between the;instantaneous value of the normal velocity and the quantity L. This;retardation tends to decrease in accordance with the inner dynamics,;which has a relaxation character.

Rev. Lett. 104, 255702 (2010)]. Here we examine;possible high-T, P polymorphism in Ta with complementary DFT-based model;generalized pseudopotential theory (MGPT) multi-ion interatomic;potentials, which allow accurate treatment of much larger system sizes;(up to similar to 80000 atoms). We focus on candidate bcc, A15, fcc,;hcp, and hex-omega phases for the high-T, P phase diagram to 420 GPa,;studying the mechanical and relative thermodynamic stability of these;phases for both small and large computational cells. Our MGPT potentials;fully capture the T = 0 DFT energetics of these phases, while MGPT-MD;simulations demonstrate that the higher-energy fcc, hcp, and hex-omega;structures are only mechanically stabilized at high temperature by;large, size-dependent, anharmonic vibrational effects, with the;stability of the hex-omega phase also being found to be a sensitive;function of its c/a ratio. Both two-phase and Z-method melting;techniques have been used in MGPT-MD simulations to determine relative;phase stability and its size dependence. In the large-cell limit, the;two-phase method yields accurate equilibrium melt curves for all five;phases, with bcc producing the highest melt temperatures at all;pressures and hence being the most stable phase of those considered. The;two-phase bcc melt curve is also in good agreement with dynamic;experimental data as well as with the MGPT melt curve calculated from;bcc and liquid free energies. In contrast, we find that the Z method;produces only an upper bound to the equilibrium melt curve in the;large-cell limit. For the bcc and hex-omega structures, however, this is;a close upper bound within 5% of the two-phase results, although for the;A15, fcc, and hcp structures, the Z-melt curves are 25%-35% higher in;temperature than the two-phase results. Nonetheless, the Z method has;allowed us to study melt size effects in detail. We find these effects;to be either small or modest for the cubic bcc, A15, and fcc structures,;but to have a large impact on the hexagonal hcp and hex-omega melt;curves, which are dramatically pushed above that of bcc for simulation;cells less than 150 atoms. The melt size effects are driven by and;closely correlated with similar size effects on the mechanical stability;and the vibrational anharmonicity. We further show that for the same;simulation cell sizes and choice of c/a ratio, the MGPT-MD bcc and;hex-omega melt curves are in good agreement with the QMD results, so the;QMD prediction is confirmed in the small-cell limit. But in the;large-cell limit, the MGPT-MD hex-omega melt curve is always lowered;below that of bcc for any choice of c/a, so bcc is the most stable;phase. We conclude that for the non-bcc Ta phases studied, one requires;simulation cells of at least 250-500 atoms to be free of size effects;impacting mechanical and thermodynamic phase stability.

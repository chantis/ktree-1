To describe collective plasma;excitations in the 2DEG, we develop a generalized transmission line;theoretical formalism consistent with the plasma hydrodynamic model. We;then apply this formalism to analyze the plasmonic spectra of 2DEG;systems with steplike periodic changes of electron density, gate;screening, or both. We show that in a periodically modulated 2DEG, a;plasmonic crystal is formed, and we derive closed-form analytical;expressions describing its energy band spectrum for both infinite and;finite size crystals. Our results demonstrate a nonmonotonic dependence;of the plasmonic band gap width on the electron density modulation. At;so-called transparency points, where the plasmon propagates through the;periodic 2DEG in a resonant manner, the plasmonic band gaps vanish. In;semi-infinite plasmonic crystals, we demonstrate the formation of;plasmonic Tamm states and analytically derive their energy dispersion;and spatial localization. Finally, we present detailed numerical;analysis of the plasmonic band structure of a finite four-period;plasmonic crystal terminated either by an ohmic contact or by an;infinite barrier on each side. We trace the evolution of the plasmonic;band spectrum, including the Tamm states, with changing electron density;modulation and analyze the boundary conditions necessary for formation;of the Tamm states. We also analyze interaction between the Tamm states;formed at the opposite edges of the short length plasmonic crystal. The;validity of our theoretical approach was confirmed in experimental;studies of plasmonic crystals in short, modulated plasmonic cavities;[Dyer et al., Phys. Rev.

The measured 1/f;noise around the magnetic hysteresis loops of the free layer indicates;that the main origin of the 1/f noise is the magnetic fluctuation, which;is discussed in terms of a fluctuation-dissipation relation. Random;telegraph noise (RTN) is observed to be symmetrically enhanced in the;hysteresis loop with regard to the two magnetic configurations. We found;that this enhancement is caused by the fluctuation between two magnetic;states in the free layer. Although the 1/f noise is almost independent;of the magnetic configuration, the RTN is enhanced in the antiparallel;configuration. These findings indicate the presence of spin-dependent;activation of RTN. Shot noise reveals the spin-dependent coherent;tunneling process via a crystalline MgO barrier.

This is confirmed by an;analytical calculation which shows that spin-torques have no effect on;the Arrhenius escape rate associated with thermally activated domain;wall depinning in this geometry.

Therefore inelastic;scattering processes of helical Dirac electrons become possible, as;described by a dynamical local self-energy of second order in the;exchange interaction. The self energy influences bound-state formation;and leads to significant new anomalies in the LDOS at low energies and;low temperatures, which we calculate within the T-matrix approach. We;propose that they may be used for spectroscopy of local impurity spin;states by appropriate tuning of the chemical potential and magnetic;field.

In this paper, we answer;this question for two-dimensional (2D) bosonic SPT phases with Z(N) and;U(1) symmetry. We find that while the low-energy modes of the gapless;edges are nonchiral, symmetry acts on them in a "chiral" way, i.e., acts;on the right movers and the left movers differently. This special;realization of symmetry protects the gaplessness of the otherwise;unstable edge states by prohibiting a direct scattering between the left;and right movers. Moreover, understanding of the low-energy effective;theory leads to experimental predictions about the SPT phases. In;particular, we find that all the 2D U(1) SPT phases have even integer;quantized Hall conductance.

To this end, we further develop the general,;finite-temperature real-time transport formalism by introducing field;superoperators that obey fermionic statistics. This direct second;quantization in Liouville Fock space strongly simplifies the;construction of operators and superoperators that transform irreducibly;under the Anderson-model symmetry transformations. The fermionic field;superoperators naturally arise from the univalence (fermion-parity);superselection rule of quantum mechanics for the total system of quantum;dot plus reservoirs. Expressed in these field superoperators, the causal;structure of the perturbation theory for the effective time-evolution;superoperator kernel becomes explicit. Using the constraints of the;causal structure, we construct a parametrization of the exact effective;time-evolution kernel for which we analytically find the eigenvectors;and eigenvalues in terms of a minimal set of only 30 independent;coefficients. The causal structure also implies the existence of a;fermion-parity protected eigenvector of the exact Liouvillian,;explaining a recently reported result on adiabatic driving;[Contreras-Pulido et al., Phys.

B 85, 075301 (2012)] and;generalizing it to arbitrary order in the tunnel coupling Gamma.;Furthermore, in the wide-band limit, the causal representation;exponentially reduces the number of diagrams for the time-evolution;kernel. The remaining diagrams can be identified simply by their;topology and are manifestly independent of the energy cutoff term by;term. By an exact reformulation of this series, we integrate out all;infinite-temperature effects, obtaining an expansion targeting only the;nontrivial, finite-temperature corrections, and the exactly conserved;transport current follows directly from the time-evolution kernel. From;this new series, the previously formulated RT-RG equations are obtained;naturally. We perform a complete one-plus-two-loop RG analysis at finite;voltage and magnetic field, while systematically accounting for the;dependence of all renormalized quantities on both the quantum dot and;reservoir frequencies. Using the second quantization in Liouville space;and symmetry restrictions, we obtain analytical RT-RG equations, which;can be solved numerically in an efficient way, and we extensively study;the model parameter space, excluding the Kondo regime where the;one-plus-two-loop approach is obviously invalid. The incorporated;renormalization effects result in an enhancement of the inelastic;cotunneling peak, even at a voltage similar to magnetic field similar to;tunnel coupling Gamma.

For this purpose, Ge NCs embedded in an SiO2;matrix with controllable size, density, and structure were fabricated;using magnetron sputtering. The size dependence of the Ge plasmon;energies in the size range of 5-9 nm is shown to be well depicted by the;so-called medium quantum confinement (QC) model, with an effective mass;of 0.57m(0) (contrary to expectations of a stronger quantum effect). In;the very low-loss region of the EEL spectra, an apparent blue shift of;the E-2 interband transition peak up to 2 eV and a strong reduction in;the oscillator strength were measured for the NCs in the size range of;4-6 nm. It indicates for this smaller size range a transition to a QC;regime where the band structure and the density of states are modified;dramatically. These trends are explained by a combination of low-loss;and core-loss EELS results, which show that the Ge NCs are surrounded;uniformly by nearly stoichiometric SiO2. This local chemistry is shown;to provide an infinite potential barrier and to confine electrons and;holes in the spherically shaped Ge NCs. In addition to pure QC effects;in the Ge NCs, the SiO2 matrix thus plays an important role in the;strength of the observed QC and interband transitions.

For the single-chain magnet formed by the;strongly anisotropic manganese(III) acetate meso-tetraphenylporphyrin;complexes coupled to the phenylphosphinate ligands, the experimental;metamagnetic-type magnetization curve in the c direction yields an;accurate estimate of the values of correlation energy Delta(xi)/k(B) =;7.93 K and exchange coupling J/k(B) = 1.20 K.

The formulas in the existing literature are frequently;incomplete, incorrect, or lack a derivation; in particular, Hall;viscosity is overlooked. Our approach begins from the response to a;uniform external strain field, which is an active time-dependent;coordinate transformation in d space dimensions. These transformations;form the group GL(d, R) of invertible matrices, and the infinitesimal;generators are called strain generators. These enable us to express the;Kubo formula in different ways, related by Ward identities; some of;these make contact with the adiabatic transport approach. The importance;of retaining contact terms, analogous to the diamagnetic term in the;familiar Kubo formula for conductivity, is emphasized. For;Galilean-invariant systems, we derive a relation between the stress;response tensor and the conductivity tensor that is valid at all;frequencies and in both the presence and absence of a magnetic field. In;the presence of a magnetic field and at low frequency, this yields a;relation between the Hall viscosity, the q(2) part of the Hall;conductivity, the inverse compressibility (suitably defined), and the;diverging part of the shear viscosity (if any); this relation;generalizes a result found recently by others. We show that the correct;value of the Hall viscosity at zero frequency can be obtained (at least;in the absence of low-frequency bulk and shear viscosity) by assuming;that there is an orbital spin per particle that couples to a perturbing;electromagnetic field as a magnetization per particle. We study several;examples as checks on our formulation. We also present formulas for the;stress response that directly generalize the Berry (adiabatic) curvature;expressions for zero-frequency Hall conductivity or viscosity to the;full tensors at all frequencies.

Within a kinetic equation approach,;we identify coefficients of response to the time-dependent external;driving and relate these to the concepts of charge and spin emissivities;previously discussed within the time-dependent scattering matrix;approach. Expressed in terms of auxiliary vector fields, the response;coefficients allow for a straightforward analysis of recently predicted;interaction-induced pumping under periodic modulation of the gate and;bias voltage [Reckermann et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 226803 (2010)].;We perform a detailed study of this effect and the related adiabatic;Coulomb blockade spectroscopy, and, in particular, extend it to spin;pumping. Analytic formulas for the pumped charge and spin in the regimes;of small and large driving amplitude are provided for arbitrary bias. In;the absence of a magnetic field, we obtain a striking, simple relation;between the pumped charge at zero bias and at bias equal to the Coulomb;charging energy. At finite magnetic field, there is a possibility to;have interaction-induced pure spin pumping at this finite bias value,;and generally, additional features appear in the pumped charge. For;large-amplitude adiabatic driving, the magnitude of both the pumped;charge and spin at the various resonances saturates at values which are;independent of the specific shape of the pumping cycle. Each of these;values provides an independent, quantitative measure of the junction;asymmetry.

Each electron experiences a different hyperfine;interaction with the local nuclei of the lattice, leading to a relative;phase difference, and thus decoherence. Methods such as nuclei;polarization, state narrowing, and spin-echo pulses have been proposed;to delay decoherence. Instead we propose to suppress hyperfine dephasing;by the adiabatic rotation of the dots in real space, leading to the same;average hyperfine interaction. We show that the additional effects due;to the motion in the presence of spin-orbit coupling are still smaller;than the hyperfine interaction, and result in an infidelity below 10(-4);after ten decoupling cycles. We discuss a possible experimental setup;and physical constraints for this proposal. DOI:;10.1103/PhysRevB.86.245307;0;0;0;0;0;1098-0121;WOS:000312292400008;;;J;Estienne, B.;Regnault, N.;Bernevig, B. A.;D-algebra structure of topological insulators;PHYSICAL REVIEW B;86;24;241104;10.1103/PhysRevB.86.241104;DEC 12 2012;2012;In the quantum Hall effect, the density operators at different wave;vectors generally do not commute and give rise to the Girvin-MacDonald-;Plazmann (GMP) algebra, with important consequences such as ground-state;center-of-mass degeneracy at fractional filling fraction, and;W1+infinity symmetry of the filled Landau levels. We show that the;natural generalization of the GMP algebra to higher-dimensional;topological insulators involves the concept of a D commutator. For;insulators in even-dimensional space, the D commutator is isotropic and;closes, and its structure factors are proportional to the D/2 Chern;number. In odd dimensions, the algebra is not isotropic, contains the;weak topological insulator index (layers of the topological insulator in;one fewer dimension), and does not contain the Chern-Simons theta form.;This algebraic structure paves the way towards the identification of;fractional topological insulators through the counting of their;excitations. The possible relation to D-dimensional volume-preserving;diffeomorphisms and parallel transport of extended objects is also;discussed.

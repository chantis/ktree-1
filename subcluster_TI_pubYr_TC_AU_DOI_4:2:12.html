  TC:6  AU: ;FN Thomson Reuters Web of Science™;1.0;J;Aizin, Gregory R.;Dyer, Gregory C.;Transmission line theory of collective plasma excitations in periodic;two-dimensional electron systems: Finite plasmonic crystals and Tamm;states;PHYSICAL REVIEW B;86;23;235316;10.1103/PhysRevB.86.235316;DEC 28 2012;2012;We present a comprehensive theory of the one-dimensional plasmonic;crystal formed in the grating-gated two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG);in semiconductor heterostructures. To describe collective plasma;excitations in the 2DEG, we develop a generalized transmission line;theoretical formalism consistent with the plasma hydrodynamic model. We;then apply this formalism to analyze the plasmonic spectra of 2DEG;systems with steplike periodic changes of electron density, gate;screening, or both. We show that in a periodically modulated 2DEG, a;plasmonic crystal is formed, and we derive closed-form analytical;expressions describing its energy band spectrum for both infinite and;finite size crystals. Our results demonstrate a nonmonotonic dependence;of the plasmonic band gap width on the electron density modulation. At;so-called transparency points, where the plasmon propagates through the;periodic 2DEG in a resonant manner, the plasmonic band gaps vanish. In;semi-infinite plasmonic crystals, we demonstrate the formation of;plasmonic Tamm states and analytically derive their energy dispersion;and spatial localization. Finally, we present detailed numerical;analysis of the plasmonic band structure of a finite four-period;plasmonic crystal terminated either by an ohmic contact or by an;infinite barrier on each side. We trace the evolution of the plasmonic;band spectrum, including the Tamm states, with changing electron density;modulation and analyze the boundary conditions necessary for formation;of the Tamm states. We also analyze interaction between the Tamm states;formed at the opposite edges of the short length plasmonic crystal. The;validity of our theoretical approach was confirmed in experimental;studies of plasmonic crystals in short, modulated plasmonic cavities;[Dyer et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 126803 (2012)], which demonstrated;excellent quantitative agreement between theory and experiment.;DOI:10.1103/PhysRevB.86.235316;9;0;0;0;9;1098-0121;WOS:000312833200005;;;J;Arakawa, Tomonori;Tanaka, Takahiro;Chida, Kensaku;Matsuo, Sadashige;Nishihara, Yoshitaka;Chiba, Daichi;Kobayashi, Kensuke;Ono, Teruo;Fukushima, Akio;Yuasa, Shinji;Low-frequency and shot noises in CoFeB/MgO/CoFeB magnetic tunneling;junctions;PHYSICAL REVIEW B;86;22;224423;10.1103/PhysRevB.86.224423;DEC 28 2012;2012;The low-frequency and shot noises in spin-valve CoFeB/MgO/CoFeB magnetic;tunneling junctions were studied at low temperature. The measured 1/f;noise around the magnetic hysteresis loops of the free layer indicates;that the main origin of the 1/f noise is the magnetic fluctuation, which;is discussed in terms of a fluctuation-dissipation relation. Random;telegraph noise (RTN) is observed to be symmetrically enhanced in the;hysteresis loop with regard to the two magnetic configurations. We found;that this enhancement is caused by the fluctuation between two magnetic;states in the free layer. Although the 1/f noise is almost independent;of the magnetic configuration, the RTN is enhanced in the antiparallel;configuration. These findings indicate the presence of spin-dependent;activation of RTN. Shot noise reveals the spin-dependent coherent;tunneling process via a crystalline MgO barrier.

We show;that the nucleation process is well-described by a modified Neel-Brown;model taking into account the spin-transfer torque, whereas the;depinning process is independent of the current. This is confirmed by an;analytical calculation which shows that spin-torques have no effect on;the Arrhenius escape rate associated with thermally activated domain;wall depinning in this geometry. Furthermore, micromagnetic simulations;indicate that spin-transfer only weakly affects the domain wall motion,;but instead modifies the inner domain wall structure.

In all these models, the flatness ratio for the;TFBs is larger than 30 and increases with increasing Chern number. In;the presence of appropriate interparticle interactions, these models are;likely to lead to the formation of Abelian and non-Abelian fractional;Chern insulators. As a simple example, we test the C = 2 model with;hardcore bosons at 1/3 filling, and an intriguing fractional quantum;Hall state is observed.

We found that site;energies show disorder and that correlations in the site energies and a;distribution of deep traps must be included in order to reproduce;measured charge mobility-field curves at low charge densities in bulk;PFB and F8BT. The parameter set from the mobility-field curves;reproduces the unipolar current in single layers of PFB and F8BT and;allows us to deduce charge injection barriers. Finally, by combining;these disorder descriptions and injection barriers with an optical;model, the external quantum efficiency and current densities of blend;and bilayer organic PV devices can be successfully reproduced across a;voltage range encompassing reverse and forward bias, with the;recombination rate the only parameter to be fitted, found to be 1 x;10(7) s(-1). These findings demonstrate an approach that removes some of;the arbitrariness present in transport models of organic devices, which;validates the KMC as an accurate description of organic optoelectronic;systems, and provides information on the microscopic origins of the;device behavior.

The thermodynamic integration (TI) method is implemented;in a general MC algorithm in order to evaluate the absolute Gibbs energy;of the liquid and the fcc solutions.

Using this coupling, we demonstrate an easy-to-form, stable,;nondestructive, and electrically rewritable switch on magnetic domain;wall propagation.

Further, the;Joule heating dissipation contribution and the noise-equivalent;dissipation energy were reduced by setting a smaller amplitude. Usage of;a high resonance frequency and a smaller amplitude enables us to perform;highly sensitive measurements of the atomic-scale adhesion and the;tip-instability-related energy dissipation.
